### Foreword

*Hello and welcome to your promising new career at the MetaLinguistic Department of the Federal Department of Anomalous Containment! Quite a mouthful, right? I'm afraid you'll have to get used to it, because around here, you have to watch your language. Literally. Trust me, you'll find that funny once you pick up Second Language and start to see the words floating through the walls of your corner office.*

*Jokes aside, this really is the place to be for those of you who love linguistics, science, or technology! Or maybe you're one of the folks who heard something they weren't supposed to - no, I don't mean government secrets, although we've certainly got plenty of those on hand - or read something that swapped your hands with your feet. Not kidding, that happened to me a while back. Took forever to get that fixed. But that's the great thing about working here; there's always something new and crazy to discover, some new story to create and/or find, and unlike in the Folkloric Creature Containment department, you don't get ripped apart by a vampire when you press the wrong button on the coffee machine. Just don't touch The Book, stick to your job, and collect one of the biggest paychecks a government office can hand out.*

*Oh, and before you head on into the jungle of training documents ahead, take some deep breaths in and out. They can be a bit stuffy the first time you read them, and I mean that literally **and** figuratively. Once you get to the whole C-0 thing that keeps The Book from causing another Altered-Reality Event on the level of England's existence, you'll get why it's gotta be like that.*
- JF, Director
