# Sahroh Lake

> The following is documentation on the singular "Truth" breach that occurred while Linguistic Anomaly 0 was present in MetaLinguistic Containment. Unfortunately, attempting to refer to this event consistently results in severe Linguistic Corruption. In this case, the document has been converted into the traditional formatting of the "SCP Wiki", an online creative writing project that focuses on a secret government-independent organization which "secures" and "contains" anomalous objects and creatures. Investigation into whether this community is aware of the Federal Department of Anomalous Containment is ongoing.

### Incorrect Statements in Corrupted Documentation

- Psycopathy and Sociopathy provide no protection from Sahroh Lake's memetic effects.
- There is no record of anything similar to a "Stoneward" event ever occurring.
- Sahroh Lake's actual classification is Linguistic Anomaly 1 (LA-1).
- Dr. Cartwright is `not` an actual staff member of the Department of `MetaLinguistics`.
- Current research indicates that Brenda Peynado, in combination with LA-0, caused Sahroh Lake's anomalous properties, not the other way around as the below documentation indicates.
- For historical documentation: the town on the shores of `SCP-7`roh Lake has existed since 1927. Exclusionary Site 91 was built in 1985.
- For metahistorical documentation: The breach of LA-0 that led to the creation of Lake Sahroh occurred in 2021. Prior to this, neither Sah`143` Lake or Exclusionary Site 91 existed.
- `Sahroh Lake's memetic radius is not growing.`

### Sahroh Lake Altered-Reality Event

**Item #: SCP-7143**

**Object Class: Euclid**

**Disruption Class: VLAM**

**Risk Class: Caution**

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7143 is contained by the function and maintenance of Exclusionary Site 91, a Foundation outpost 11 miles northwest of Traverse City, MI, USA. Exclusionary Site 91 can be recognized as a Shell brand gas station on the side of South Cedar Road, with a chain-link fence protruding in the direction of Lake Leelanau. To ensure adequate staffing in case of a breach of the fence by an instance of SCP-7143-2, all Foundation staff at Exclusionary Site 91 are required to score 15 or higher on the Hale Psychopathy Checklist. All ES 91 staff must ensure that no information on SCP-7143 escapes, including any residents of The Lakeshore, whether they are instances of SCP-7143-2 or not. This includes preventing entry to The Lakeshore’s radius by maintaining and powering the 5.4 miles of electric fence surrounding it. During a “Stoneward” event, ES 91 staff should remain in contact with local Foundation military and MTF personnel in case force is necessary.

**Description:** SCP-7143 is the southernmost shore of the unnamed lake[^1] between Victoria Creek and Cedar Run. SCP-7143 produces a localized cognitohazardous effect in a 1,240[^2][^3][^4] ft. radius[^5], causing multiple physical and memetic effects in susceptible individuals, which are considered dormant. Should an individual inside the radius of SCP-7143 experience severe trauma for the first time in their life, the effects of SCP-7143 will become active, and the individual will slowly become an instance of SCP-7143-2. The only exceptions are people with psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies – for unknown reasons, even severe trauma experienced within The Lakeshore’s radius by these individuals has no anomalous effects. The following effects have been consistently observed in susceptible persons:

 - A granite stone, classified as SCP-7143-1, begins to grow on the affected individual. SCP-7143-1 instances seem to follow a set of clear rules, although the Foundation has not yet determined the cause for all of them. Only one instance of a stone will grow on an affected person, regardless of the strength of the trauma, repeated trauma, whether the individual is a visitor[^6] or a resident of The Lakeshore, or their distance from The Lakeshore (as long as they are within the radius.) The stone grows in a different place on each individual, as well as growing at a different speed, growing to a different size, and reaching maturity at a different time. While the basis for these changes is unclear, they are consistent to individuals – SCP-7143-1 will never speed up or slow down in growth.
 - The affected individual will feel compelled to kneel on The Lakeshore by a strong memetic effect. This same effect informs affected individuals that “when the stone is mature, kneel by The Lakeshore and you shall be free.” These exact words have been stated by every instance of SCP-7143-2 interviewed. However, there does not seem to be a consistent way to determine when SCP-7143-1 is mature, leading to affected individuals spending significant amounts of time kneeling on The Lakeshore.
 - When the stone falls off, the affected individual is now considered a mature instance of SCP-7143-2.
 - While still retaining a majority of their individuality, instances of SCP-7143-2 are strongly influenced by the memetic effects of their matured SCP-7143-1. The only physical indication of a mature SCP-7143-2 instance is a scar somewhere on their body, usually on the exterior[^7]. These individuals will attempt to spend as much of their time as possible being near to The Lakeshore, and appear to derive pleasure from handling their stone. SCP-7143-2 instances rarely show any desire to leave the radius of SCP-7143’s congitohazard, and as such have established a small, unnamed village next to The Lakeshore itself. This community appears to function as expected, including self-sufficiency in farming and population, with no anomalous properties itself.

While it is unclear if SCP-7143 or the stones it produces are sentient, the Foundation has observed a desire for expansion. During the third day of the lunar new year, SCP-7143-2 instances experience a different memetic effect for 12 hours, nicknamed a “Stoneward” event. Instead of being attracted to their stones, they are repulsed by them, and seek to get as far away as possible from The Lakeshore in any direction. If they find a person while travelling in this way, they will attempt to persuade them to return with them to The Lakeshore, and if that fails, they will resort to violence, proceeding to drag the unconscious victim back towards The Lakeshore. This capture has occurred a total of 8 times, with 3 of those having become SCP-7143-2 instances, including one Foundation operative. Since the discovery of immunity from psychopathy and instituting the Hale Checklist requirement, no foundation operatives have been converted to SCP-7143-2 instances, and have escaped safely.

**Addendum:** Due to the memetic properties of SCP-7143, ES 91 staff are tasked with discovering potential memetic breaches in popular culture. Below is a list of currently known potential breaches and ES 91 staff conclusions:

 - On May 11, 2021, author Brenda Peynado published “The Rock Eaters”, a book of short stories. One of these stories, “The Stones of Sorrow Lake”, displayed a town and lake with significant similarities to SCP-7143, including SCP-7143-1 instances, the scars, and the compulsive desire to stay near The Lakeshore. The story presents a more peaceful and social version of the town, including trade and immigration/emigration with the outside world. The tone remains fairly negative, however, with the protagonist’s story not having a happy ending. The story also omits many features of SCP-7143, such as the pleasure SCP-7143-2 instances experience by holding their stone, and any indication of a Stoneward event. Interviews between undercover Foundation operatives and Peynado showed no indication that she was aware this was a real place, but when asked to further describe the area around what she thought of as “Sorrow Lake,” the details were exact matches to the current environment. In one test, ES 91 staff carved a symbol into a nearby tree, and Peynado was able to describe the symbol with remarkable accuracy. Since being administered Class B amnestics, Peynado has no longer been able to accurately describe SCP-7143’s geographical area, instead drawing on imagination as expected. Dr. Cartwright, head of ES 91, has submitted a request to reclassify SCP-7143 as Keter Containment Class and Keneq Disruption Class given this evidence that certain memetic effects may extend outside the known radius.
 - Brandon Sanderson’s use of the term “Stoneward” in The Stormlight Archive is considered coincidental.
