# Anomaly 109 - "The Core"

### Foreword

*Alright, this one's a little unique, because it's not one of ours. Or it wasn't, and now it is. This* was *a document from the Federal Department of Anomalous Containment's subdepartment of Mechanical Anomalies. Apparently, it used to be a transcript of one of their big investigations into "Anomaly 109". They found out on this little trip that there was this huge mass of gears and pistons and chrome just growing under the city of Pittsburgh. Long story short, team finds the source of it, bottles it up, the giant machine disintegrates, end of story. They're the guys with the budget for these things, and the actual combat training, so it hardly even seemed out of the ordinary.*

*So now you're thinking, "Why am I reading this to train for this department? I failed the robotics comprehension test." Well, about six weeks after they'd contained it, the whole document just transformed. One second it's nice and official, next second it's a short story with a very different form of events. Now, before you panic, this wasn't a Truth breach. Nothing in our world changed. But it was the fastest example of Linguistic Corruption we'd ever seen, and to add to the mystery, it was a document about an anomaly that nobody thought had anything to do with language. And yet, here we are, with our department holding on to a document so corrupted that it's useless to the original writers. Luckily, our job is researching this stuff, and you might be surprised at how many of Anomalies from outside of our department end up having their docs sent here. Maybe it's The Book, maybe it's those anomalies; jury's still out on that, but we know it's our job - your job, now - to figure out why this keeps happening. Might be worth knowing, on that note, that the leader of the expedition was named Abraham.*

### Anomaly 109

`(For the reader: only text in this format matters. Disregard any superscript text and consider anything else to be a distraction.)`

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

The Heart of The City beat quietly today, and just as steady as ever. That was good; it meant he could tell where more of his tools were, without having to grope around in the dark with his hands. Of course, he didn’t have to do that often anyway. He was an expert, a professional, and in the uncountable years he had spent in this lightless cavern, he had come to know every rough, damp crevasse, every sharp piece of gravel, by touch or taste or scent or sound, as he tended to the Heart. His expertise was needed. The Heart of the City was `important`.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

Father Abraham supervised his parishioners as they dug into the grey-brown rock wall he saw before him. The light from the torch he held aloft kept the scene lit, but its flickering, fiery nature kept the shadows leaping back in, and then out, in and out over the sweaty backs of the men with pickaxes who toiled on his whim, his plea. Father Abraham’s encouraging smile did not reach his eyes as he stared at the cavern wall before him. The beat was close now, the rocks being shattered before him bringing him closer to the beast, the demonic sound that had infested his nightmares, whose every pulse clouded the edges of his vision with `red`.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

One sense he wished he had was time. Tending to the Heart, he wasted none of that precious commodity, but sometimes sleep took him unexpectedly, and he wished he could plan for that, predict it so he wasn’t in the middle of a task. Today, he had sensed a dozen things wrong already, and had diligently set about with the odd shapes of rubber, metal, and wood that the Heart had told him were tools. A wrong scent there – sulfur where it should be charcoal – a grinding sound in the smooth, bulbous shape an arm’s length from his toolkit, the taste of `iron` in his mouth. He had fixed each of these a million times before, and with ease unhindered by the visual void, had already dealt with the first two. He – A cracking sound, so tiny he barely heard it. Cracks were rare, and never good. But – another crack, slightly louder, slightly closer, and like the first, in the wrong direction. Not from the Heart, but from behind him, towards where he slept when he felt the feeling approach. It grew louder, the cracks growing into a cacophony of crashes and strange garbled sounds.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

The cavern wall was thin now, he could tell. The pulse around his eyes was growing overwhelming, and even his parishioners seemed to feel something wrong – a primal sense that this ungodly beast was here, perhaps. He could imagine it now, the very picture of a classical devil, horns and all. It was his `call`, his crusade, to wipe it out. Another pickaxe rung against the wall – a few more hits, and it would collapse, revealing the beast’s layer.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

The sounds were violent, angry. He huddled in a crevasse that barely began to fit him. Then came the greatest sound he’d ever heard, crashes upon cracks upon the pitter-patter of gravel, and something horrible poured into the room. He had not known his eyes had lids, yet they snapped shut as the <sup>burning sensation</sup> clawed its way into every corner of the cavern. The Heart beat unperturbed, yet he could feel his own race to the speed of the <sup>flickering thing</sup> that seemed to be inside his skull. As his shock wore off, he heard those garbled sounds again, loud and sharp this time. They came from an area where he heard the sounds his feet made when moving, yet he knew he was still – some monster, then, tricking him, bringing <sup>this desecration of the way of things</sup> into the home of the Heart of the City. He would not fail in his duty, would not be quelled by the <sup>violent violation of sensation</sup> nor the heat that rose from the monster’s hide. He rose, terrified no longer, set to face this as was his duty. The garbled sounds changed, remaining loud and sharp but gaining the same tone that the smallest chunk of gravel makes as it scrapes across the rock. He charged, his feet falling hard on the gravel whose pokes told him where each and everything important was, and grabbed the monster by its heated, wood-textured claw which <sup>emanated that which broke him from his work</sup>, trying to snap it off with his single hand. Yet this monster was wily, and its claw clung tightly to its body, while odd sensations of something large hitting him in the chest repeatedly reminded him of the harsher, more rhythmic beatings he received when he stepped in the wrong place around the Heart. An `idea` came to him then, an `idea` so inspired he was amazed it was his own.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

Father Abraham barely had time to scream as the wiry, shut-eyed human picked him up by his coat and flung him into the pit of gears, pendulums, belts, pistons, and a single shining silver sphere above it all, reflecting his terrified face in the firelight for a heartbeat. His last sensation was his skull shattering. The gears hardly paused in their `essential` work. The torch snapped, Father Abraham's bones snapped, all in time with the eternal rhythm, `Ka-dum, Ka-dum, Ka-dum, Ka-dum,` all once again right with the world.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`

He had felt sleep come on long ago, and yet had stayed at work, cleaning the odd mush that now cluttered the workings of the Heart of The City. The burning in his skull had faded over time, and when the other garbled noises had fled, he knew he had beaten the monster. So he worked, and when he finally finished, his questing hands felt something truly new where his bed of stone had once been. A hole to another room, and in his eventual explorations, he would find that his world had doubled in size. The night after, he would fall asleep praising the Heart’s `generosity`, and the morning after, he would do the same while working until he tired once again.

`Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum. Ka-dum.`
