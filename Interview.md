# An Interview with Brenda Peynado

> The following is transcribed footage of an interview with author Brenda Peynado. It was recorded on May 14th, 2021, by a Federal Department of Anomalous Containment Crisis Response Team (disguised as a news crew.) Unfortunately, on checking the recording, all of Peynado's dialogue could only be interpreted as a gentle crackling sound, similar to slowly crinkling aluminum foil. Peynado's dialogue, as well as the video, has been omitted to prevent further Linguistic Corruption of the transcription.

## Relevant History

On April 27th, 2021, LA-0 vanished from its containment locker at the Department of MetaLinguistics' Anomaly Warehouse. At the same time, the DML was, were, and had always been running Exclusionary Site 91 to protect general Consensus Reality from the memetic effects of Sahroh Lake. After less than a month, a DML agent discovered the publication of *The Rock Eaters*, a collection of short stories which included *The Stones of Sorrow Lake*. This story had a remarkably accurate depiction of Sahroh Lake's anomalous effects. Agent 7 was sent to pose as an interviewer, with Agent 9 posing as a cameraman, in the hopes that Peynado knew about the location of LA-0. They brought a replica of The Book in case she did.

## The Interview

 - **Agent 7:** Thank you for taking the time to talk to us today. We had a great time reading your new collection of short stories, and wanted to ask some questions about it, if that's alright?
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** Well then, I wanted to start by asking about my personal favorite story, "The Stones of Sorrow Lake". How did you come up with the idea for it?
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** Sounds like an impressive rough draft by itself. Didn't sound like the difference between it and the final story was that major - or is this just me knowing nothing about writing coming through?
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** Interesting, what about that particular journal would you say was inspiring?
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** Wow, I guess the phrase "blood, sweat, and tears" really applies here, huh? Would you mind if we take a look?
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** I learn something new every day. What's this bound in? It feels, well, kinda uncomfortable. A little like skin.
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - {Agent 7 makes the swap, passing the real LA-0 to Agent 9}
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** Er, I'm afraid I don't understand - this is the journal you just gave me.
 - **Peynado:** {Static Omitted}
 - **Agent 7:** Shit, run for it!
 - **Agent 9:** Fuck, it got on my hand! 
 - {At this point the camera is dropped, ending the recording}

## Aftermath

Due to the bravery of Agents 7 and 9, LA-0 was recovered and recontained without any further Class-10 "Truth" breaches. Both survived the incident.
