# The Book

## Anomalous Item Description

### Physical Description

Linguistic Anomaly 0 (LA-0), also known as The Book[^1], is a 347-page hardcover book, of which 309 pages remain entirely blank. LA-0 is bound in a material that physically and chemically resembles human skin, although DNA tests show a closer match to Bonobo skin, minus fur. Tests to determine what material forms the "hardcover" underneath the skin-like substance have been inconclusive due to an inability to pierce the outer layer. The pages bound in LA-0 are standard A-4 8.5" by 11" letter paper, and contains no anomalous properties by itself[^3]. Regardless of treatment, age, or other environmental effects, LA-0 appears to be freshly printed.

### Anomaly Description

Linguistic Anomaly 0 (LA-0) has multiple anomalous effects, one of which is classified as one (1) of three (3) Class-10 anomalies. Below are listed each anomalous property of LA-0, sorted from least to most severe (defined as potential for harm to consensus reality.)

| Effect Shorthand   | Results of Uncontained Effect  | Governing Containment Protocol | Anomaly Hazard Level |
|:---------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|:---------|
| Agelessness | Natural wear does not occur on any part of LA-0. | N/A | Class-0 |
| Impenetrability | It is not possible to pierce, burn, dissolve, or "harm" LA-0 in any way. | [C-1](#containment-protocol-c-1) | Class-1 |
| Visual Memetic Compulsion | On viewing LA-0, *homo sapiens* are compelled to find a writing instrument, and write on the blank pages of The Book. This effect is strengthened if LA-0 is opened to a blank page. This effect can be reduced by thoroughly understanding the concept of (memetics.)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics] The power of this effect appears to be increasing since initial containment. | [C-1](#containment-protocol-c-1) | Class-3 |
| Subconscious Memetic Compulsion | Upon exposure to LA-0's Visual Memetic Compulsion, affected persons will be unable to stop thinking about LA-0, and writing in The Book. Psychological symptoms are generally consistent with an ADHD "hyperfixation", allowing for normal functioning paralleled with a constant desire to be writing in LA-0 instead. Symptoms decrease gradually over three (3) months. | [C-1](#containment-protocol-c-1) | Class-4 |
| Life | Multiple tests have concluded that LA-0 is alive, although not sentient. While it seems to harbor no motivation, only reacting to environmental stimuli where applicable, this is yet another to reason to handle testing on The Book with severe caution. | N/A | Class-4 |
| Linguistic Corruption | Any media[^4] within 13.7 meters of LA-0 begins to experience severe linguistic divergence from its original form. This can result in the affected media changing languages, alphabets, converting to Second Language, or turning into entirely new languages[^5]. | [C-0](#containment-protocol-c-0) and [C-1](#containment-protocol-c-1)| Class-7 |
| Truth | Anything written on a blank page of The Book becomes true. | [C-0](#containment-protocol-c-0) | Class-10 |

## Anomalous Item Containment 

### Containment Protocol C-0

Containment Protocol C-0 is arguably `the most critical function` of the *Department* of **Meta**Lin~~guistics~~. C-0 is the formatting and language choice used in every document that refers, even indirectly, to The Book<sup>!</sup>. C-0 is especially important`, and especially potent! Get yours today` in this, or any, direct description and classification of LA-0<sup>Los Angeles 0</sup><sub>Linguistic Anomaly 0</sub>, as direct references to Theh Boook are affected by anomalous Linguistic Corruption regardless of distance or containment status. In short, to keep written documentation of **LA-0**, the protocols in [the below addendum](#c-0-addendum---known-linguistic-countereffects) should be followed. Remember - each and every piece of syntax - and each and every word - is chosen for a reason - to maintain relevant balance and ccontainment.
C-0 isn't just `The best thing since sliced bread` for uncorrupted communication about LA-0 itself, however. C-0's main purpose is to suppress and slow any occurrences of `El Libro`'s Class-10 Anomalous Effect, codenamed "Truth". In the event of a breach of LA-0 where something is written in it, C-0 will prevent the reality-altering effects of `kooB ehT` from occurring for exactly five (5) minutes and thirty-two (32) seconds. 

### C-0 Addendum - Known Linguistic Countereffects

| Countereffect | Effective Usage Tips | Strength |
|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:--------:|
| Misspelings | Use sparingly. Occasional use can decrease the effects of Subconscious Memetic Compulsion, but overuse results in increased Linguistic Corruption. | 0.8 CEU |
| Tables | Low CEU, but no evident downside. | 1.2 CEU |
| Italics, Bold, and Strikethrough | For unknown reasons, only useful is preventing Linguistic Corruption of [C-0](#containment-protocol-c-0). | 2.4 CEU |
| Superscript and Subscript | Slows Linguistic Corruption. Individuals affected by Subconscious Memetic Compulsion report severe migraines after reading, writing, or hearing Subscript/Superscript countereffects. | 10.3 |
| Linking to other parts of the same Document | Significantly decreases the rate of Linguistic Corruption. However, Linguistic Corruption is more likely to replace the corrupted segment with misinformation instead of changing it to another language or linguistic structure. | 19.8 CEU |
| "Code Block" formatting | Significantly slows Class-10 "Truth" breaches. However, text in this format is usually Corrupted within hours. | 27.3 CEU |

### Containment Protocol C-1

Linguistic Anomaly 0 (LA-0) is to be kept in a standard-size lead-coated storage locker at our on-site warehouse. Warehouse employees may move this locker as they see fit. Opening the locker without first consulting three (3) supervisors and two (2) warehouse employees will trigger several silent alarms alongside a release of large amounts of `cartoon knockout gas` within the warehouse. `Please don't do that, as it generally inconveniences the warehouse employees`.
Nothing is permitted to be written in LA-0 without explicit permission from a supervisor of clearnace Level 7 or higher. Anything considered "gibberish" is never to be written regardless, given the severe damage to Consensus Reality that could and has caused.

## Known History of Anomalous Item

### Pre-1793

Based on the language and age of the ink on the first page of LA-0, it is believed The Book is the first example of written language. The text itself is a merchant's log documenting trade in the Indus River Valley. 8 pages are used this way.
The next entry in LA-0 is a series of prayers written in cow's blood, which carbon date to approximately 43 BCE. The prayers are for wellness and riches, generally, and given the properties of LA-0, it's likely these prayers resulted in Consensus Reality shifting to accomodate these request coming True. 3 pages are used in this way.

### Post-1793

| Owner   | Period Owned (years)  | Effects |
|:---------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Nasir Shariq | 1793 - 1796 | Unearthed LA-0 by accident, and wrote only a single thing. His single sentence, "قبضتك الشيطانية علي لن تنجح", which roughly translates to "Your demonic hold on me shall not succeed", indicates he was aware of The Book's influence, and managed to trade it away to an eccentric American book collector. |
| Henry Williamson (and 3 generations of his children) | 1796 - 1879 | Purchased LA-0 from Nasir in 1796. According to family histories uncovered over time, Henry collected books solely as decoration and to impress his fellow landowners, as he could neither read nor write. This appears to have limited the damage he could have done to Consensus Reality through LA-0. However, during this time, someone scrawled the word "England" into The Book, below Nasir's writing. Research on whether England existed at this point is ongoing, but most evidence points to England being created by this scrawl, creating a history, landmass, people, and future for the country through a single previously-unknown word.
| Earl and Carrie Logan | 1879 - 1920 | Siblings and cultists who pulled The Book from the burned wreckage of the Williamson home. Their attempts to use the already-written text as incantations to summon "dark forces" did not succeed, but when they eventually wrote "grant us unimaginable power" (in their own blood, which likely made no difference), they and LA-0 disappear from historical records until 1994, when LA-0 reappeared on the desk of Paola Carrasco. Earl and Carrie Logan did not reappear. |
| Paola Carrasco | 1994 - 2002 | An audio engineer, Paola used LA-0 as a journal of her life for eight (8) years. Since most of what she wrote presumably already happened to her, it can be generally be assumed that she changed Consensus Reality very little. However, in 1996 she wrote "I wish there was something better than the dogshit mixers they make me use at work." This led to a copy of FL Studio Pro, and a laptop capable of running it, appearing on her doorstep. She was apprehended by the Federal Department of Anomalous Containment in 2002 due to reports of her exceptional abilities in audio mixing. |

### Post-Acquisition and Containment

LA-0 was acquired by the Federal Department of Anomalous Containment in 2002, and the amount of department effort needed to contain it eventually led to the rise of the Department of MetaLinguistics. Since then, only a single "Truth" breach has occurred[^6], with several being initiated but prevented by [C-0](#containment-protocol-c-0) and the swift response of our containment teams.
